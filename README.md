This project focuses on a key challenge in the banking sector: predicting whether a 
credit card applicant is likely to default. As retail banks increasingly rely on quick, 
data-driven decisions, managing risk effectively remains a top priority. By using a 
modified version of the Credit Card Approval Prediction dataset, this study combines 
demographic and repayment information from more than 360,000 customers to 
support smarter and more automated decision-making. 
Three machine learning models were tested to tackle this classification problem: 
Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. After careful data 
preparation and model comparison, Random Forest was found to be the most 
effective, with a strong ROC AUC score of 0.75 and a recall of 0.41. To show how 
these results translate into real business value, a profit simulation was performed. 
The outcome suggested a potential average gain of about 99 dollars per applicant. 
To keep the model explainable and fair, SHAP values were used, helping ensure that 
decisions could be interpreted clearly and aligned with regulatory standards. 
In conclusion, machine learning can support banks in building faster, more accurate, 
and transparent systems for credit card approval.
